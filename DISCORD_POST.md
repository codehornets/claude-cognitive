🧠 **claude-cognitive** - Working memory for Claude Code

Built this because I was running 8 concurrent Claude instances on a 1M+ line codebase and the context rediscovery was brutal.

**What it does:**
- Attention-based context injection (HOT/WARM/COLD files)
- Multi-instance coordination (no duplicate work)
- 64-95% token savings

**Validated on production:**
- 1M+ lines, 4-node architecture, 80K+ interactions
- 8 concurrent instances, multi-day sessions

**15-minute setup, MIT licensed**

Looking for beta testers - especially if you have large codebases or run multiple instances. Feedback welcome! 🙏
