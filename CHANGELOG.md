## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-08 (Development Preview)

⚠️ **This is a development preview release** - v1.2 Phase 1 features are experimental

### Added - v1.2 Development (Experimental)
- **Usage Tracking System** (⚠️ Preview/Observation Mode):
  - `scripts/usage_tracker.py` - Core tracking logic with Ralph Loop learning pattern

  - `scripts/add-usage-tracking-hook.py` - Hook installer utility
  - Tracks which `.claude/*.md` files are injected vs actually used
  - Maps documentation to source code relationships
  - Calculates usefulness scores (0.0 to 1.0) per file
  - Auto-adjusts keyword weights after 50 turns (learning mode)
  - Generates: `.claude/usage_stats.json`, `.claude/usage_history.jsonl`, `.claude/keyword_weights.json`

- **v1.2 Architecture Documentation** (4000+ lines):
  - `V1.2_INTELLIGENCE_ROADMAP.md` - Complete 4-phase roadmap
  - `RALPH_LOOP_INSIGHTS.md` - Design philosophy (700+ lines)
  - `.claude/modules/usage-tracker.md` - Tracking system design (850+ lines)
  - `.claude/modules/foraging-agent.md` - Discovery agent design (900+ lines)
  - `.claude/modules/doc-refiner-agent.md` - Maintenance agent design (700+ lines)

  - `V1.2_PHASE1_PROGRESS.md` - Phase 1 progress report
  - `INTEGRATION_PROGRESS.md` - Integration status and metrics
  - `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Latest development session notes

### Changed - v1.2 Integration
- **`scripts/context-router-v2.py`**:
  - Added usage tracker integration (injection logging)
  - Added learned keyword weight loading from `.claude/keyword_weights.json`
  - Applies learned weights during attention calculation
  - Graceful fallback if tracker unavailable
- **`~/.claude/settings.json`** (via installer):
  - Added `usage-track-stop.py` to Stop hooks array
  - Runs automatically after each conversation turn

### Added - v1.1.2 Stable Features
- **Project-local keyword configuration**: Keywords, co-activation, and pinned files now load from `.claude/keywords.json` instead of being hardcoded in the script
  - Config lookup order: project `.claude/keywords.json` > global `~/.claude/keywords.json` > empty defaults
  - Added `load_project_config()` function in `context-router-v2.py`
  - Added `templates/keywords.json.example` template file
  - Added example `keywords.json` to small-project example

### Changed - v1.1.2 Stable Features
- **docs_root resolution**: Now prefers project-local `.claude/` directory over global `~/.claude/`
  - Priority: `CONTEXT_DOCS_ROOT` env > project `.claude/` > global `~/.claude/`
- Updated all documentation to reference `.claude/keywords.json` instead of editing the Python script
  - `CUSTOMIZATION.md`: Complete rewrite for JSON config
  - `README.md`: Updated Quick Start step 5 and added Project Configuration section
  - `SETUP.md`: Added "Create Keywords Config" step
  - `docs/guides/getting-started.md`: Updated customization instructions
  - `docs/concepts/attention-decay.md`: Updated pinned files and troubleshooting sections

### Removed
- Hardcoded MirrorBot-specific keywords, co-activation rules, and pinned files from `context-router-v2.py` (~220 lines)

### Experimental
All usage tracking features are marked as experimental/preview:
- Infrastructure is complete and functional
- Currently in observation/data collection phase
- Learning mode activates automatically after 50 turns
- Validation pending with real usage data
- Can be disabled by removing stop hook

### Design Philosophy: Ralph Loop
This release embodies the **Ralph Loop pattern**: Iterate → Measure → Learn → Refine → Repeat
- Build foundation, observe real usage, learn from data, iterate
- Not "design perfect system then implement"
- Adaptive intelligence through iteration, not one-shot optimization

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Pool loader hardcoded fallback** (#2): Replaced hardcoded "MirrorBot/CVMP" fallback in `pool-loader.py` with dynamic project name detection
  - Added `get_project_name()` function that detects project from:
    1. Git remote URL (extracts repo name from origin)
    2. Git repository root directory name
    3. Current working directory name
    4. Generic fallback: "Current Project"
  - SessionStart hook now shows actual project name instead of misleading example data
  - Thanks to @sbozh for reporting!

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Attention History Tracking**: Every turn now logs structured attention state to `~/.claude/attention_history.jsonl`
  - Turn-by-turn record of which files were HOT/WARM/COLD
  - Tracks transitions between tiers (what got promoted, what decayed)
  - Captures prompt keywords and activated files
  - Records total context size per turn
  - 30-day retention (configurable)

- **History CLI** (`scripts/history.py`): Query and view attention trajectory over time
  - Filter by time window (`--since 2h`, `--since 1d`)
  - Filter by instance ID (`--instance A`)
  - Filter by file pattern (`--file ppe`)
  - Show only transitions (`--transitions`)
  - Summary statistics (`--stats`)
  - JSON output (`--format json`)
  - Last N entries (`--last 20` default)

- **Fractal Documentation Support**: Nested file routing for hierarchical zoom
  - Added support for `modules/t3-telos/trajectories/convergent.md` pattern
  - Parent files co-activate children on mention
  - Child files co-activate parent for context
  - Enables "zoom in" to specific details while maintaining overview

- **Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive [Fractal Documentation](./docs/concepts/fractal-docs.md) conceptual guide
  - Added History Tracking section to README
  - Updated Architecture diagram to include history.py
  - Updated Roadmap to reflect v1.1 as current

### Changed
- `context-router-v2.py`: Now persists turn-by-turn attention state with transitions
  - Added `compute_transitions()` to track tier changes
  - Added `append_history()` to log structured data
  - Deep copy state before mutation for accurate diff tracking
  - Fail-safe error handling (history write errors don't block hook)

### Why This Matters
The router always knew which files were HOT/WARM/COLD. Now that knowledge persists, letting you answer questions like:
- "What path did we take to stabilize PPE last week?"
- "Which modules got neglected during the anticipatory coherence sprint?"
- "Show me attention flow around t3-telos since Dec 25"

**Launch Metrics (48 hours):**
- 33,000+ Reddit views
- #1 post on r/claudecode
- #18 on Hacker News
- 80+ GitHub stars
- 6 forks
- Active Discord engagement with beta users

  - Attention decay (files fade when not mentioned)
  - Co-activation (related files boost together)
  - Token budget enforcement (25K char ceiling)
  - Project-local first, global fallback strategy

- **Pool Coordinator v2.0**: Multi-instance state sharing
  - Automatic mode: Continuous updates (detects completions/blockers from conversation)
  - Manual mode: Explicit `pool` blocks for critical coordination
  - Works with persistent sessions (days/weeks long)
  - Project-local strategy (matches context router)
  - 5-minute cooldown on auto-updates

- **Complete Documentation**:
  - README.md with comprehensive overview
  - SETUP.md with 15-minute quickstart

- **Production Validation**:
  - Tested on 50,000+ line codebase
  - Validated with 8 concurrent instances
  - 64-95% token savings measured
  - Multi-day persistent session support

### Fixed
- Pool system workflow mismatch (designed for short sessions, now supports persistent)
- Project-local vs global state file inconsistency
- Instance ID handling in pool relevance scoring

### Technical Details
- Python 3.8+ compatible
- No external dependencies for core scripts
