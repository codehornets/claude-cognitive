4. **Public** repository
5. Do NOT initialize with README/license/gitignore
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

```bash

# Add remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/claude-cognitive.git

## 💡 RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### "This doesn't work for me"
```
Thanks for trying it! Can you share:
1. Your OS/setup
2. The error message
3. Steps you followed

I'll help troubleshoot - this kind of feedback is exactly what beta is for!
```

### "How is this different from just using .cursorrules?"
```
Great question! cursorrules are static instructions.

claude-cognitive is dynamic:
- Files activate/deactivate based on what you're working on
- Token budget enforced automatically
- Multi-instance coordination (if you run multiple Claude sessions)

They complement each other - cursorrules for "always do X", claude-cognitive for "load relevant context Y".
```

### "I tried it and saved X tokens!"
```
Awesome! Would you be willing to share this as a testimonial? Either:
- GitHub Discussion post
- Quote for README (can be anonymous)

Super helpful for others evaluating whether to try it!
```

## 📝 POST-LAUNCH UPDATES

**Based on feedback, prioritize:**

1. **Fix critical bugs** (within hours)
2. **Clarify confusing setup steps** (same day)
3. **Add FAQ for common questions** (within 2 days)
4. **Build requested examples** (within 1 week)
5. **Write deep-dive docs** (based on actual needs, not speculation)
