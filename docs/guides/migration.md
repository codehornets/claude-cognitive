# Migration Guide - Adding to Existing Project

> **Status:** Coming soon based on beta feedback

This guide will cover adding claude-cognitive to projects already in development.

## Placeholder Topics

We plan to cover:
- Migrating from no documentation
- Migrating from existing docs (README, wikis, etc.)
- Gradual adoption strategies
- Preserving existing workflows
- Handling legacy documentation
- Team adoption patterns

## Migration is Incremental

**Good news:** You don't need to document everything at once.

Start with:
1. Create `.claude/` directory
2. Document 2-3 critical systems
3. Use for a week, see what's missing
4. Add documentation as you discover gaps

## Help Shape This Guide

**What's YOUR migration scenario?**

- Existing documentation you want to preserve?
- Team resistant to documentation changes?
- Large backlog of undocumented systems?
- CI/CD that needs updating?
- Git history concerns?
