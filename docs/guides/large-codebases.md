# Large Codebases (50k+ lines)

> **Status:** Coming soon based on beta feedback

This guide will cover strategies for using claude-cognitive on large codebases.

## Placeholder Topics

We plan to cover:
- Organizing 50k+ line projects into documentation
- Keyword strategies for complex systems
- Co-activation graphs for deep integrations
- Managing token budgets across many files
- Team coordination patterns
- Real-world examples (MirrorBot: 1M+ lines, 3200+ modules)

## Validation Context

**claude-cognitive was built on a 1M+ line production codebase.**

Strategies documented here are battle-tested, not theoretical.

## Help Shape This Guide

**What's YOUR large codebase challenge?**

- Monorepo with multiple projects?
- Microservices architecture?
- Deep nested dependencies?
- Multiple programming languages?
- Legacy code + new code?

**Share your scenario:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/GMaN1911/claude-cognitive/discussions)

We'll write this guide based on actual beta user needs.
