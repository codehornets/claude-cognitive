# Fractal Documentation

> **Status:** Coming soon based on beta feedback

This document will explain the infinite-zoom documentation strategy used in claude-cognitive.

## Placeholder

The fractal documentation concept involves:
- Summary at every level (file headers, sections, subsections)
- Increasing detail as you "zoom in"
- Consistent structure across all documentation
- Topology visible at every tier (WARM shows structure even when HOT shows details)

## Help Shape This Doc
